- what should be instance variables?(fields in obj)
    - (String) model
      (String) SN
      (boolean) power
      (int) temp,den,FanSP
      (String) Mode
- what should be instance methods?(method in obj)
    - turn on
        - this method will change power to true;
        - set temperature ,density from input
        - set fan speed to 1 and mode to Normal
        - this method don't return anything
    - turn off()
        - this method will change power to false;
        - set temperature to 0 ,density to 0 ,fan speed to 0 and mode to " "
        - this method don't return anything
        - this method don't need input
    - change fan speed
        - this method will change fan speed 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> ...
        - this method don't return anything
        - this method don't need input
    - change mode
        - this method will change mode from Normal -> Performance -> Silence -> Normal -> ...
        - if mode = Normal ,fan Speed don't change
          if mode = Performance ,fan Speed will change to 3
          if mode = Silence ,fan Speed will change to 1
        - this method don't need input
        - this method don't return anything
    - show screen
        - this method get input from object variable (power,temp,den,fanSP,Mode)
        - this method will print all object variable to Terminal
- what should be class variables?(fields in class)
    - (int) count
- what should be class methods?(method in class)
    - get count
        - this method will count an Air-purifier
        - this method don't need input
        - this method will return count variable
